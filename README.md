# Weather Application

This is a simple weather application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to check the current weather conditions for any city by entering its name.

## Features

- **Dynamic Weather Icon:** The application displays a weather icon based on the current weather conditions (e.g., clear, cloudy, rainy).
- **Temperature, Humidity, and Wind Speed:** Along with the weather icon, the application also displays the current temperature, humidity, and wind speed for the selected city.
- **Error Handling:** If the user enters an invalid city name or if there is a network error during the API call, the application displays an error message prompting the user to enter a valid city name.
